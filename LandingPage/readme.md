# Anatomy of the original ZOmato landing page

## 1. Header :

1. In the heade you'll first see a navbar at the top which has 3 links, first one being the `Get the App` second one being `Login` and third one being `Sign up`. `Get the App` link is to the left of the screen and the other two are to the right.
   Here we'll use flexbox to create this layout.
2. In the header there's also a background image, so we'll add that as well (Make sure to specify the height of header for image to show up)

3) Once done with the background image for header, we'll move to the navbar section
